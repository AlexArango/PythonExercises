# Here's some strange stuff that I will type correctly

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

# Typing \n makes the string continue on a new line. Even at the beginning!
months = "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# Combining strings
print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months: ", months

# Triple quotes allow you to types lines upon lines on end
# If you put triple single quotes ('''), the little quotes won't appear for every string!
print '''
There's something bothering me
I really am sorry, but it just couldn't wait
With a healthy dose of make believe,
won't you lie to me and make me believe.
